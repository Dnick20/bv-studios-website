### ðŸš« **Prevent Duplicates with Claude Code (IMPORTANT!)**

Before creating new components/files, always check for existing functionality:

```bash
# Claude Code workflow (recommended)
npm run claude:check                 # Full duplicate analysis
npm run claude:search [feature]      # Search specific functionality
npm run claude:imports               # View available imports

# Quick duplicate check
npm run check-duplicates

# Search for specific functionality
grep -r "function.*ComponentName" .
```
